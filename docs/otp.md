# Documentation

The acronym OTP stands for both one-time password and one-time passcode, an  automatically generated sequence of characters valid for a single login session or transaction. The OTP can be letters and/or numbers and sent via SMS, email or as a voice message as part of the MFA process. OTPs can also be sent as push notifications to an enterprise’s custom mobile apps or a third-party authenticator app can be used, like Google Authenticator. 

A one-time password expires quickly and cannot be reused, making it more secure than traditional passwords that users may reuse for multiple applications. Benefits include:

- Because an OTP is a form of authentication factor required for MFA, a hacker using a compromised credential won’t be able to gain access to your resources without it.

- Hackers will have a hard time guessing OTPs, even if they have automated password cracking tools. 

CIAM API provides support of OTP using modern authentication type such as TOTP.
