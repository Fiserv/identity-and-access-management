# MFA using YubiKey

The YubiKey is a hard token that acts as a hardware authenticator. It’s fast, simple and inexpensive to deploy, thanks to its multi-protocol capability and compatibility with existing security infrastructure. And it doesn’t require a battery or network connectivity, so it’s always on and accessible. 

CIAM API allows you to use YubiKey hardware token to access your account with the added security of multi-factor authentication.
