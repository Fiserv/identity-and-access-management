# MFA using TOTP 

TOTP stands for Time-based One-Time Passwords and is a common form of two factor authentication (2FA). Unique numeric passwords are generated with a standardized algorithm that uses the current time as an input. The time-based passwords are available offline and provide user friendly, increased account security when used as a second factor.

TOTP 2FA benefits - 

- Offline support

- PII-less registration 

- Standardized authentication solution 

- Software based, not dependent on carrier fees or telephony access and deliverability 

- Faster average time to authenticate


TOTP authentication is a multi-step process where  device registration as a pre-requisite before it  can be used for  MFA, refer below information device registration and authentication.
