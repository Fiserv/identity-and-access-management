# What is CIAM Risk

CIAM Risk is a service that leverages machine learning and configurable policies to secures authentication by considering past user behavior, IP reputation, anonymous network detection and other risk predictors. 

## How it Works

CIAM Risk's intelligence-based policies combine the results of multiple risk predictors to calculate an overall risk score. The score correlates to policies that determine the type and amount of friction to introduce into the user authentication flow. Optimize scores for each predictor, aggregate predictors, add signals from third parties, and create overrides.

Predictors include bot detection, IP velocity, user velocity, geovelocity anomaly, user location anomaly, IP reputation, anonymous network, user risk behavior, user-based risk model, new device detection, suspicious device detection, custom/third-party predictors, and composite predictors.
