# Getting Started with CIAM API

Fiserv Identity and access managment API  provides a simple way through [Developer Studio](?path=docs/Getting-Started/Getting-Started-Dev-Portal.md) to integrate Identity and access managment functionality such as multi-factor authentication functionality. 

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is an authentication method in which a computer user is granted access only after successfully presenting two or more pieces of evidence (or factors) to an authentication mechanism: 
Knowledge (something the user and only the user knows)
Possession (something the user and only the user has)
Inherence (something the user and only the user is)

By their nature, inherent factors are the strongest authentication factors and pose the lowest risk to security vulnerability.


Fiserv CIAM API  gives you access to  most advance and secure authentication options.
